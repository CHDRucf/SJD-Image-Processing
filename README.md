# SJD Image Cropping System

This is an archived copy of a UCF Senior Design team project that parsed images of dictionary pages from Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English language and created headword-level images.

These images will be used in the Johnson's Dictionary Online project (https://johnsonsdictionaryonline.com).
